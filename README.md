# Visualizing Electric Vehicle Trends with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project involved leading an Electric Vehicle (EV) analysis using Tableau to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and data insights. The analysis focused on total vehicles, average electric range, and the market share of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). Interactive visualizations, including line charts, map charts, bar charts, pie charts, and tree maps, were created to illustrate trends in vehicle distribution, geographical adoption, manufacturer dominance, and model preferences.

## Key Objectives

- To analyze the overall distribution and trends of electric vehicles.
- To evaluate the average electric range and performance metrics.
- To understand the market share and adoption rates of BEVs and PHEVs.
- To visualize data insights through interactive Tableau dashboards.

## Key Skills and Tools

- **Data Visualization**
- **Tableau**
- **KPI Analysis**
- **Chart Design**
- **Geospatial Visualization**
- **Trend Identification**

## Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Imported EV data into Tableau.
   - Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accuracy and relevance.

2. **KPI Analysis:**
   - Analyzed key performance indicators such as total vehicle counts, average electric range, and market share of BEVs and PHEVs.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created various types of visualizations to depict trends and insights:
     - **Line Charts**: To show trends in vehicle distribution over time.
     - **Map Charts**: To illustrate geographical adoption of electric vehicles.
     - **Bar Charts**: To compare manufacturer dominance and model preferences.
     - **Pie Charts**: To represent the market share of different vehicle types.
     - **Tree Maps**: To provide a hierarchical view of model preferences.

4. **Interactive Dashboards:**
   - Designed interactive dashboards in Tableau to allow users to explore the data insights dynamically.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Vehicle Distribution Trends:**
  - Identified significant growth trends in the distribution of electric vehicles over time.
  
- **Geographical Adoption:**
  - Highlighted regions with the highest adoption rates of electric vehicles.

- **Manufacturer Dominance:**
  - Analyzed which manufacturers hold the largest market share and which models are most popular.

- **Market Share Analysis:**
  - Compared the market share of BEVs versus PHEVs, providing insights into consumer preferences.

## Conclusion

The project successfully visualized trends and insights related to electric vehicle distribution, performance, and market dynamics using Tableau. The interactive dashboards enable stakeholders to explore data in-depth and make informed decisions based on the visualized trends and metrics.
